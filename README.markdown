Pyglet Examples Read Me

This repository contains a collection of OpenGL examples that use pyglet. The following is a list of the examples:

1. PygletOpenGLIntro creates an OpenGL context and draws a rectangle.
2. PygletTextureLoadImmediate loads an image as a texture and draws the texture on the screen.
3. PygletLoopAudio builds upon the texture loading example by looping background music.

Each examples in this repository is a single file. Placing these examples in one repository made more sense than creating a repository for each example.
